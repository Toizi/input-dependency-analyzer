    1. move constructor arguments to be assigned by setters
    2. change the name for getRefInfo

paper:
    definitions for source, sinks and props
    try specifying main as source for taint analizer
    specify that talking about clang taint analizer

    see if taint analizers in general should handle control flow deps

composite type processing:
    case of composite type containint composite type
    a value dependent on an element of composite type
    processInstrForOutputArgs: assigning to element of composite type arg will be considered as modifying that element
